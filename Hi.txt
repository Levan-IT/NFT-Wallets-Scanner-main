Hello,

I am an experienced C# developer with strong expertise in debugging and fixing issues related to program functionality. I have reviewed your requirements and the repository, and I am confident in my ability to:

Identify the issues with the non-functional button and fix its navigation to the next page.
Ensure the program correctly enters random values and allows the 'Start' button to trigger as intended.
Resolve the issue preventing the mobile emulator window from appearing.
I will provide a quick turnaround and ensure the program works as expected. Please note that Iâ€™ll thoroughly check the code to address all issues before making any fixes.
